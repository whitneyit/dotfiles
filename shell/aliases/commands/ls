# to the `$PATH` variable, and this file is named `ls`, any references to `ls`
# will trigger this command instead of the OS `ls` command.
#
# Using this knowledge we can create multiple versions of the `ls` command and
# target each of them at specific OS's. Now because the Mac version of `ls` does
# not have all of the options that everyone else has access to, we have to come
# up with two different commands to handle these needs. Also if an invalid
# option is passed to `ls` on a Mac it will throw an Error.
#
# So here we create two commands, noth called `list`. This `list` command will
# be defined based upon the running OS.

# Here we define the `list` command for Mac users.
